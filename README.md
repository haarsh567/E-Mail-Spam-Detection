# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for email spam detection. The system is designed with a user-friendly graphical interface created using Streamlit, and the underlying machine learning models are implemented using Jupyter Notebook. The primary algorithm used for classification is Naive Bayes, supplemented by other algorithms for comprehensive testing and comparison.

## Features

- **Streamlit GUI:** A web-based graphical user interface powered by Streamlit for ease of use.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation:** Python code and machine learning models are implemented and tested in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Naive Bayes Algorithm:** The main algorithm used for email spam classification.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Additional machine learning algorithms are employed for comparison and evaluation.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and feature engineering are applied to enhance model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
